# KidKinder

This project represents a platform for various kid's courses. It can be used by a user who is not logged in (as a guest) and by a teacher or parent as logged in user. Depending on the role of the user, a course can be viewed, created, edited, booked, unbooked, deleted.

## This is an application for:
* accounts for teachers and parents
* kid's courses
* kid's courses bookings

## The application has:
### Public part (pages accessible without authentication)
* Home - contains basic information about the platform
* About - the idea of the platform and how to work with it
* Courses - list of courses with some baseic details
* Teachers - list of registered teachers
* Login - form where the registered user can login
* Register - form for registering a new user

### Private part (pages available for registered users)
* for users who are registered as a teacher






## This project was built with:
* [React.js](https://reactjs.org)
* [Back4app](https://www.back4app.com/)
* [HTML Codex](https://htmlcodex.com)

and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).




## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
